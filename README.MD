## Motivation: ##

- Having studied Economics in undergrad, I've developed a keen interest in the intersection between economics and computer science, particularly in the realm of Game Theory. While there are many ways that Game Theory intersects with computer science, this project will focus on its application in the field of cybersecurityâ€”or what is often referred to as the "Economics of Security."

- As I delved into this  field, I found that a multitude of approaches have been employed to optimize resource allocation and attack-defense models, among other things in these Game Theoretic models. However, one growing area of research incorporates elements of deception and non-rational play into models. I'll be exploring this here.
